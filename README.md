# csc411 project
the code first creates a public class called ITstudent with its member variables declared including their data types
then we included a code for calculating the average mark for each student whereby we considered all courses taken by the student and then calculates his or her average.A student with an average mark greater or equals to 50 has passed
then we created a class buffer which is used to store and retrieve the student data. The buffer's size was initialized and conditions were specified for the buffer.If the buffer is not empty and not full it can be accessible and data can be added to it.
Then we produced a function which was used to randomly generate the student data using the random algorithm rd.
a function to save each of the student data to xml files was created and this xml files are then stored or uploaded to the buffer
the we  created a fuction to to read the student data from the buffer.each file in the buffer has its corresponding number.If a file is consumed from the buffer then it is removed.
A producer function was created whereby student data will be produced up until the xml files are 10. Then the student data was saved into buffer
A consumer function was then created and implementation restrictions were made
